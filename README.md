## Motivation

During early 2020, I thought about using **Flutter Web** to make a _"Web-only"_ Flutter project. Initial implementations were unsatisfying though, as it was still in beta, and lacked some features like proper handling of mouse scrolling. (I'm sure Flutter web is much better now).

So I switched to HTML and CSS instead.

I tried to make it visually similar to, if I someday make up my mind to build it, the Flutter web version, but I took some liberties in giving it its flavour.
